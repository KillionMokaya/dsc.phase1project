# Business Understanding 
## Introduction
Microsoft Corporation is a multinational technology company that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports, and sells computer software, consumer electronics, and personal computers. It is known for its flagship products like the Windows operating system, Microsoft Office suite, and Azure cloud computing platform. Product diversification into new sectors enables a corporation reduce dependence on a single industry, tap into new markets, cross-sell, adapt to evolving consumer needs, and sustain long-term success. 
 Diversifying to create original video content can help Microsoft expand their brand presence and reach a wider audience, enhancing their overall visibility and reputation. Also, movies provide opportunities for cross-promotion and product placements, allowing Microsoft to showcase its products and services to a massive audience.   Venturing into movies can open up new revenue streams through licensing and distribution agreements.  
## Problem Statement
Diversification should be approached strategically and based on evidence from market research for successful expansion.  There is a need to understand market trends particularly levels of investment and returns. Also understanding of customer preference is indispensable   in order to invest in products which resonate with the demand and have significant returns. This understanding enables one to make informed decisions, tailor products to the target market, develop effective marketing strategies, and mitigate potential risks. By gaining insights into the new market's opportunities and challenges, a corporation can position themselves for successful diversification and increase the likelihood of achieving desired outcomes.
Companies have accrued significant profits from the movie industry. However, this is not guaranteed as the returns are determined by a number of risk factors.  In this regard, I analyze historical data on varied variables to determine what determine profits from movies to inform investment decisions.  
## Main Objective
To determine factors that influence profitability of movie genres.
### Specific Objectives
I.	What are the top produced genres of movies?
II.	Do average rating, runtimes, budget and production budget influence profitability of movies?
III.	What genres should the company consider investing in?

## Data Understanding
The data used was downloaded from the Box Office Mojo and IMDB. Inline with the objective, the analysis focused on variables which are defined below. 
* Genres: Category of artistic composition, characterized by similarities in form, style, or subject matter for a piece of content.
* Production budget: The production cost of a movie.
* Worldwide gross: Box office revenues from all countries the movie sold.
* Profit:	Computed as worldwide gross less production budget
### Data Decision. 
I decided to focus only on productions budgets and a worldwide gross of more than $10million. Also, focused on movies with a rating of five and above
## Conclusions
* There is a positive correlation between profit and production budget (0.65) and a weaker positive correlation with average rating (0.19) and runtime minutes (0.20). These correlations suggest that higher production budgets tend to result in higher profits, while the impact of average rating and runtime is comparatively smaller.
* A comparison of top 10 genres and top-rated genres with gross and profitability shows high ratings do not guarantee movie profitability. 
* Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi and Adventure, Animation, Comedy are the top genres with the highest production budgets and profits.
* Drama, Documentary, and Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi receive high ratings with moderate production budgets.
* Drama, Comedy, and Adventure, Animation, Comedy are popular genres with moderate production budgets and modest returns 
* Investing in higher production budgets can potentially lead to higher profits in the film industry. This indicates that allocating more financial resources to the production of films could be a viable strategy for maximizing returns on investment. However, correlation does not imply causation, and there are other factors influencing profitability in the film industry. As such there is need for further research.
## Recommendations
* While choosing the movie to produce, genre, production budget and profitability should be the main factors followed by average rating.
* Focus on high-budget genres with strong profitability: Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi, Adventure, Animation, Comedy, and Action, Adventure, Fantasy have both high production budgets and significant profits. Investing in these genres can offer potential returns on investment due to their popularity and financial success.
* Consider genres with high ratings and moderate production budgets: Genres like Drama, Documentary, and Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi receive high ratings and have moderate production budgets. These genres indicate a balance between critical acclaim and financial viability, making them promising investment options.
* Explore opportunities in popular genres with moderate production budgets: Drama, Comedy, and Adventure, Animation, Comedy are popular genres with moderate production budgets. Investing in these genres can tap into widespread audience appeal while managing production costs effectively, potentially leading to profitability.
